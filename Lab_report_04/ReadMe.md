Lab Assignment 4:

Dr. Islam is building a simple OpenGL project where a black-colored background is displayed in the window. In this background, he places an upside-down triangle at the center of the screen. The triangle starts with a cyan color and gradually transitions to white as time progresses and vice versa.  He wants the OpenGL window to open with the title set as your ID, and when the Escape key is pressed, the triangleâ€™s color should immediately change to red. Apply your knowledge to implement this behavior for his project.
