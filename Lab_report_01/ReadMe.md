Task: Lab Assignment 1
Create a dedicated GitHub Repository for this course and submit the folder link for this assignment. Add a proper README file. Follow proper code formatting. Add comments where necessary (Prove that it has been run in your computer). Your work must be original. Late submission = 50% penalty. 

Create a cyan colored window containing your full name as the window name. If the user presses the keyboard's key "your name's first letter", the window gets closed. Upload a screenshot of your output with the VS Code terminal showed at the same image in the repository as well.
