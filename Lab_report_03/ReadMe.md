Lab Assignment 2: Hello Triangle


Dr. Chowdhury is building a simple OpenGL project where a cyan-colored square is displayed on a white background. 
On top of this square, he places a cyan triangle such that the triangle shares two corner points of the square. 
He wants the OpenGL window to open with the title set as your name, and the program should close when the first letter of your name is pressed. 
Apply your knowledge to implement this behavior for his project.
